create a new network:
docker network create myNetwork

After that connect your containers to the network:
docker network connect myNetwork web1
docker network connect myNetwork web2 

Check if your containers are part of the new network:
docker network inspect myNetwork

Then test the connection:
docker exec -ti web1 ping web2
